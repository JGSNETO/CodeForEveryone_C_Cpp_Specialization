/*
So, initially, C++, the initial innovation was turning C into an object-oriented language by creating the concept class and data hiding within the C language. 
That was originally called C with classes and then C++ in 1985. 

- Standard template library accepted in july 1994 into C++ ANSI Standard. 
- STL library provides containers, iterators and algorithms designed to:
1. Work efficiently
2. Work parametrically
3. Work orthogonally. 

# Two varieties of containers
1. Sequence: ordered by sequence of elements
2. Associative: Keys for looking up elements. (Deque, list, vector, set, multiset, map, multimap)

# Typical Container interfaces
- Constructors: Default constructors, copy contructors
- Elements access
- Element insertion
- Element emplacement - new C++11
- Element deletion
- Destructor
- Iterators

# Overview of Containers
- Common set of properties
- Constructores and destructors
- Elements access, insertion and deletion
- Allocate and manage memory
