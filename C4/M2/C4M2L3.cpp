# Basics of Inheritance

- Inheritance is a reuse mechanism
- Inheritance uses pure polymorphism: Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type. 
The main idea is that a single function or method can operate on different types (classes) and behave differently based on the actual type of the object.
- Inheritance imposes a type structure: Type structure refers to the organization and rules that govern types in a
programming language. It determines how types relate to each other, how they can be composed, and what kind of operations are permitted on them.
- OOP = Inheritance

# The OOP Design Methodology
1. Decide on an appropriate set of types
2. Design in their relatedness
3. Use inheritance to share code among classes

# Public inheritance = subtyping

- 90% rule: Almost always use public inheritance
- Then base class is the type of the whole hierarchy
- Private inheritance is LIKEA relationship-not a subtype but inherits code/members turning them private

# Topics on Inheritance 

- Subtyping and Code Reuse
- Typing conversions and visibility
- Abstract base classes
- Multiple inheritance
- Inheritance and Design
- Detailed C++ Considerations
