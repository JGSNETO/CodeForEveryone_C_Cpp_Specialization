/*
# Virtual Member Functions

- Functions declared in base class and redefined in derived class.
- Class hierarchy defined by public inheritance creates related set of user types, 
all of whose objects may be pointed at by a base class pointer.
- By Accesssing virtual function through this pointer, C++ selects appropriate function definition at run-time.


# Pure polymorphism

- Object being pointed at must carry around type information so distinction can be made dynamically
- Each object "knows" how it is acted on.
- Inheritance designed into SW to maximize reuse and allow natural modeling of problem domain.
