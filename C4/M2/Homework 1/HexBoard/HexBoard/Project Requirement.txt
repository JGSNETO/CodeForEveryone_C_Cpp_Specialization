Homework 5 will be to add an AI that can play HEX well. 
In Homework 5 we will use ideas from the video lectures that implement a Monte Carlo determined best move that will

# The game of hex
The game of Hex has been invented in 1942 by Piet Hein, reinvented in 1948 by John Nash, got its name in 1952 
from a commercial distribution by Parker Brothers and has been popularized by Martin Gardner in 1957. 
It is similar to tic-tac-toe on a hexagonal 11x11 board.
