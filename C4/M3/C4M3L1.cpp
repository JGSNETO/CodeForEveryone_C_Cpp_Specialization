# Creating a Class

## Move semantics

Introduced in C++ 11 that allows resources to be transferred from one object to another, avoiding
unnecessary coying and enhancing performance, especially for objects that manage dynamic memory or other resources. It
is a key part of "Rule of Five" in modern C++ programming, which suggest implementing a custom move contructor and mote assignment
operator if a class manages resources directly.

## How it works

1. Move contructor: This constructor is called when an object is initialized from an r-value, which is tipically
a temporary object. Instead of making a deep copy of the resources, the move constructor transfer ownershiop of the resource
from the source object to the new object.
2. Move assignment operator: This operator is invoked when an existing object is assgined an r-value. Similar to the move
constructor, it transfer ownership of resources tather than copying them. 

## Constructor type

1. Default:  is a constructor that can be called with no arguments. It initializes objects of a class with default values. If you donâ€™t explicitly define any constructor in your class, the compiler will automatically provide a default constructor.
2. 1-arg/Conversion:  is a constructor that takes a single argument. It is called a conversion constructor because it can be used to convert a value of the type of the parameter to an object of the class type.
3. Copy: s a constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class. It is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.
