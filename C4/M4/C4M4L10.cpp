## C++ Standard Versions: Over time, the C++ standard has evolved, with new versions introducing new features, libraries, and improvements. Each version is typically named based on the year it was published. Below are some of the major C++ standards:

- C++98 (ISO/IEC 14882:1998): The first standardized version of C++.
- C++03 (ISO/IEC 14882:2003): A bug-fix release to C++98, with no major language features added.
- C++11 (ISO/IEC 14882:2011): This version introduced significant new features such as smart pointers, lambdas, move semantics, nullptr, auto keyword, range-based for loops, and more.
- C++14 (ISO/IEC 14882:2014): A minor update to C++11, introducing improvements like generic lambdas, relaxed constexpr, and other refinements.
- C++17 (ISO/IEC 14882:2017): Added new language features like std::optional, std::variant, std::filesystem, and fold expressions for variadic templates.
- C++20 (ISO/IEC 14882:2020): This version was a major update, introducing concepts, ranges, coroutines, modules, and more. It significantly expanded the capabilities of the language.
- C++23: The upcoming standard that builds upon C++20, adding more features and improvements. It is expected to be finalized in 2023.
