# Design Patterns 

- Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They offer a standard approach to solving these problems
in a way that is flexible, maintainable, and scalable. Design petterns are categorized into three main types: creational, structual ang behavioral pattern.

## Creational Patterns

- These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
1. Singleton Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
2. Factory Pattern: Provies an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Structured Pattern

- These patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects, typically dealing with relationships between them. 

1. Adapter Pattern: Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an existing class with a new interface. 
2. Decorator Pattern: Adds behavior to objects dynamically by wrapping them in a decorator object. 

## Behavioral Patterns

- These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

1. Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
2. Strategiv Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms and lets the client choose one at runtime.

## Benefits of using Design Patterns

1. Reusability: Patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems, making your code more modular and easier to understand.
2. Maintainability: By using a well-known patterns, your design becomes easier for other developers to understand and modify.
3. Scalabitly: Design patterns help in building flexible and extensible software architectures.
4. Testability: They often improve code testability by enforcing separation of concerns.
