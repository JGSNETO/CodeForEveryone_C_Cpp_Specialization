In C++, the Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. The main idea is to delegate the instantiation of objects to subclasses, allowing for more flexibility and customization in object creation without specifying the exact class of the object to be created.

Key Points of Factory Method:
- Encapsulation of Object Creation: The factory method encapsulates the object creation process, making the code more maintainable and allowing for easier changes if the object creation process evolves.
- Promotes Loose Coupling: The client code relies on abstractions (interfaces or base classes), not on concrete classes. 
This means the client doesn’t need to know the specific class name or how objects are created, which results in loose coupling between the code components.
-Single Responsibility: The factory method delegates the responsibility of creating objects to subclasses, making the code easier to manage and follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
